# Pizzeria Management System Project 

## Description

This project is a comprehensive Pizzeria Management System designed to streamline and manage the operations of a pizzeria. It consists of a robust database built using MySQL and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a Java application that interacts with the database. The system allows for efficient tracking and management of customers, orders, pizzas, toppings, discounts, and inventory levels. The application also supports various order types such as dine-in, delivery, and pickup, providing a flexible and scalable solution for pizzeria management.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to develop a real-world application that showcases the integration of database management and application development. By combining a structured database with a user-friendly Java application, this project aims to demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and deploy a full-stack solution. The Pizzeria Management System is an excellent example of how database-driven applications can be used to manage and optimize business operations.

## Technology Stack

- **MySQL**: Used to create and manage the relational database, which includes tables for customers, orders, pizzas, toppings, discounts, and more.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: The database is hosted on AWS, providing a reliable and scalable environment for data storage and management.
- **Java**: The application is developed in Java, which connects to the MySQL database and provides a user interface for managing the pizzeria operations.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used for database interaction within the Java application.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Database Structure**: The database is designed with an EERD (Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram) structure to efficiently handle all aspects of pizzeria management, including customer information, order processing, and inventory tracking.
- **Java Application**: The Java application allows users to perform various operations such as placing orders, managing customers, viewing and updating inventory, and generating reports.
- **Order Management**: Supports multiple order types including dine-in, delivery, and pickup, with detailed tracking of pizza customization and discounts.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks inventory levels for toppings and provides functionality to add or update inventory based on usage.
- **Discount Management**: Allows the application of various discounts at both the order and pizza levels.
- **Reports Generation**: Includes functionality to generate reports on topping popularity, profit by pizza, and profit by order type.

## Usage

The Pizzeria Management System is designed to be a fully functional application that can be used by pizzeria staff to manage daily operations. The Java application provides an intuitive interface for entering new orders, managing customer information, viewing inventory levels, and more. This project serves as a practical demonstration of database-driven application development and can be extended or customized for different business requirements.

## Project Status

The project is fully implemented and operational, with the database hosted on AWS and the Java application capable of interacting with the database to perform all necessary operations. For security reasons, I have removed the `DBConnector.java` file, which contains the sensitive information needed to connect to the AWS database. Additionally, I am unsure how long I will have access to the AWS services since the course is over. Future updates may include additional features, enhanced user interface design, and integration with other services.
